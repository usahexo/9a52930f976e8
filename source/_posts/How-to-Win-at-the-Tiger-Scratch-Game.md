# How to Beat the Tiger Scratch Game

The Tiger scratch game is one of the most popular instant win games in the world. With a starting jackpot of $1 million, it’s easy to see why people love playing it. However, if you want to have any chance of winning the big prize, you need to know how to play the game correctly. In this article, we will teach you everything you need to know about playing Tiger scratch, including the best ways to win.

The first thing you need to do when playing Tiger scratch is select your six numbers. These numbers can be anything from 1-36, and you can choose whichever ones you like. Once you have selected your numbers,you then need to choose whether you want to play for the jackpot or for a smaller prize. If you decide to play for the jackpot, then you must reveal all six of your numbers in order to win. If you select a smaller prize, then you only need to reveal three out of six of your numbers in order to win.

Once you have chosen your game type and selected your numbers, it’s time to start scratching! There are three different ways that you can scratch your tickets: with a coin, with a fingernail or with a coin card. We recommend using a coin card as it is the easiest way to scratch off all of your tickets at once.

If you reveal three matching symbols on any of your tickets, then you will automatically win that prize. The prizes range from $2 up to $250,000 so there is plenty of potential to win big! However, if you want a chance at winning the jackpot, then you need to match all six of your numbers.

Now that we have taught you how to play Tiger scratch, it’s time for some tips on how to win! Here are our top four tips for winning big on this instant win game:

1) Play conservatively at first – When starting out on any new scratch game, it’s always best to play conservatively until you understand how the game works. This means only selecting three out of six numbers instead of playing for the jackpot right from the start. This way, even if you don’t win big straight away,you still have a chance of walking away with a smaller prize.

2) Use a coin card – Scratching tickets by hand can be quite tedious and time-consuming, especially if there are lots of tickets left to scratch. A much easier way of scratching them all at once is by using a coin card. This is simply a card with small squares cut out where each ticket can be scratched off quickly and easily.

3) Try combinations – If none of your individual tickets seem likelytowin the jackpot , try looking at them as part of combination . By matching two or more sets of numbers together ,you increaseyour chancesof winning something . Even if it’s not the big prize , matching two out of six numbers still wins something !

4) Know when enough is enough – Sometimes it’s betterto walk away froma scratch game even ifyou have won something . Just because there is still money leftonthe ticket doesn’tmean thatyou are going toget lucky onthe next try . In fact ,the odds might be againstyou and it might be wiser toget out whileyou are ahead !
