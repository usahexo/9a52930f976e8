#  If Will Crown Casino Open Retro Reels Game, Players Could Win Big Jackpots!

When a new online slot game is announced, excitement levels always run high. If that new game is from a renowned developer, such as Microgaming, then the anticipation can be almost too much to handle! That seems to be the case with Retro Reels – a brand-new game that’s set to hit the internet this month.

What is so special about Retro Reels? For starters, it’s a five-reel slot with 20 paylines and an RTP of 96.5%. That’s pretty good given today’s competitive market. But it’s the bonus features that have players really excited! There are two in total:

1. The first is a free spins bonus round that’s triggered when three or more scatters appear on the reels. Players are awarded 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. What’s more, additional scatters will award additional spins.

2. The second bonus is a Pick Me feature that’s activated when three or more symbols with ‘Pick Me’ written on them appear on the reels. This allows players to win one of four progressive jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major or Mega.

So far, Microgaming has released very little information about Retro Reels – other than the basics we just mentioned above. However, they have hinted that this could be one of their most popular games ever! Judging by what we know so far, it’s not hard to see why.
