#  How White Men Picture From Gambling Movie Is Stirring Controversy

The new gambling movie, "21," is drawing criticism from some who say it perpetuates racist images of Asians.

In the film, a white Harvard student named Ben (played by Jim Sturgess) uses his genius math skills to count cards and win big at blackjack in Las Vegas with a group of Asian American friends.

Critics say the film reinforces the stereotype that all Asians are good at math and makes light of the exploitation of Asian Americans in casinos.

"It's another example of Hollywood's long history of using cowardice and racism to make a buck," said Guy Aoki, founder of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans.

But director Robert Luketic defended the film, saying it was based on a true story and that he had sought to avoid stereotypes.

Luketic said he was surprised by the controversy, noting that the character of Ben was based on an actual person and not meant to be representative of all white people or all Asians.

"The idea that one white person can 'save' an entire race is ridiculous," he said. "This is not a movie about white people saving Asian people."

#  White Man Picture From Gambling Movie Sparks Outrage

A still from the 1995 movie "Casino" showing actor Robert De Niro portraying a white character has sparked outrage on social media for its racist portrayal.

The image, which shows De Niro in a scene with other white characters, was tweeted on Monday by author and historian Tariq Nasheed with the caption "Casino is supposed to be about Las Vegas but this is really what it's about".

The tweet has since been retweeted over 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times.

Many Twitter users responded to the tweet criticising the movie for its racist portrayal of white people.

One user wrote "This is exactly what's wrong with Hollywood. They can't help but to paint white people as the villains."



However, some Twitter users defended the movie, saying that it was depicting how things were in Las Vegas at the time.

This is not the first time that a movie has been criticised for its racist portrayal of white people. In August 2017, "Detroit" was slammed for its negative depiction of white police officers during the Detroit Riots of 1967.

#  Picture of White Man in Gambling Movie Prompts Calls for Change

In the wake of the release of a new movie depicting a white man's gambling addiction, some are calling for Hollywood to change its ways.

The film, called "The Gambler", has sparked outrage among some who argue that it perpetuates racist stereotypes. In particular, many complain that the only character with a gambling addiction is white, while all other characters are people of color.

This, they say, reinforces the idea that gambling is a "white person's problem". It also implies that people of color are not capable of having such an addiction.

Others argue that the issue is not with the movie itself, but with the large number of movies and TV shows that perpetuate similar stereotypes. They say that Hollywood needs to do better in terms of representation, and should start by including more stories about people of color who have gambling addictions.

Whatever side you may take on this debate, it's clear that we need to start talking about these issues more openly. We can't continue to allow Hollywood to portray certain groups of people in a negative light without addressing the underlying implications.

#  Stereotypical Portrayal of White Man in Gambling Film Draws Criticism

In "Mississippi Grind," Ben Mendelsohn portrays Gerry, a white gambler with a heart of gold, opposite Ryan Reynolds' Curtis, a black hustler. The film has been criticized for its stereotypical portrayal of white men in gambling films.

Some argue that the film falls back on tired clichés about white men and their propensity for gambling. In one scene, Gerry is shown to be an upstanding citizen who goes to church on Sunday and helps out at a homeless shelter. However, he later shows his dark side by losing all his money in a poker game.

Critics say that the filmmakers could have done more to break from these stereotypes and present a more nuanced portrait of white men in gambling films. They argue that the film relies too much on the assumption that all white men are inherently good at gambling and prone to making bad choices when they lose.

Others argue that the film is actually subverting these clichés by presenting a more complex view of Gerry's character. They say that the film shows both his good and bad sides, and ultimately questions whether gambling is really worth it in the end.

Ultimately, it is up to viewers to decide whether they agree with these criticisms or not. However, it is clear that "Mississippi Grind" has sparked some important conversations about race and gender in Hollywood.

#  White Male Portrayal in Gambling Film Causes Uproar

The representation of white males in gambling-themed films has come under fire in recent weeks, with many accusing the industry of promoting a harmful and outdated stereotype.

In movies such as "21" and "The Gambler", the lead characters are almost invariably white and male, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by online commentators.

Critics argue that the prevalence of this trope perpetuates the image of gambling as a man's game, with women and people of color unfairly sidelined. They also point out that it can be damaging to those who identify with or aspire to the white male archetype portrayed onscreen.

One Twitter user said, "When all you ever see is a white guy winning at gambling, it sends the message that only he can do it. This is just one more way society tells us men are better."

Others have complained that the emphasis on white masculinity creates an unattainable ideal, furthering feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt for those who don't fit that mold.

Industry representatives have responded by saying that there is no intentional bias at play, and that any perceived lack of diversity is purely coincidental. They argue that gambling films are simply reflective of real-world demographics, which are still heavily skewed in favor of white males.

While it's true that non-white actors and female protagonists are underrepresented in Hollywood overall, the issue is particularly acute when it comes to gambling films. Out of the 50 highest-grossing titles in this genre, only six feature a lead character who isn't white and/or male.

With public pressure mounting, there is a growing movement to demand more diversity in this corner of the movie industry. Some advocates have even suggested creating specific guidelines for depicting race and gender in gambling films, similar to those already in place for other genres such as science fiction and animation.
