#  Get your share of $1.5 billion in tax savings!

Last year, businesses nationwide saved an estimated $1.5 billion in taxes as a result of the new tax law. If you’re not taking advantage of these savings, you’re leaving money on the table!

The new law includes some significant changes that can help businesses reduce their tax bill. Here are a few key changes to be aware of:

- Businesses can now immediately write off the cost of equipment purchases, making it easier to invest in new equipment and technology.

- The “pass-through” deduction allows business owners to deduct 20% of their business income, making it easier to keep more of your hard-earned money.
