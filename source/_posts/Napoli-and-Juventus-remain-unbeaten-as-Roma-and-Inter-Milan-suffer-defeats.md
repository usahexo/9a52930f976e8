#  Napoli and Juventus remain unbeaten as Roma and Inter Milan suffer defeats

The latest round of Serie A fixtures saw Napoli and Juventus maintain their unbeaten starts to the season, while Roma and Inter Milan both suffered defeats.

Napoli recorded a comfortable 3-0 win over promoted side Empoli, with goals from Lorenzo Insigne, Marek Hamsik and Dries Mertens.

Juventus were held to a 0-0 draw by AC Milan, but remain unbeaten thanks to six wins and two draws from their first eight games.

Elsewhere, Roma lost 3-1 away to Torino, with goals from Andrea Belotti, Iago Falque and Josef Martinez.

Inter Milan were also beaten on their travels, losing 2-1 at Sampdoria. Duvan Zapata and Fabio Quagliarella scored for the hosts, with Mauro Icardi netting a consolation for Inter.

#  Milan shock title contenders Juventus with late winner

In a clash of two of the top teams in Serie A, Milan came from behind to snatch a late winner against Juventus. Goals from Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala looked to have given the home side all three points, but Hakan Calhanoglu’s stoppage time free-kick secured an important win for the visitors.

The result sees Juventus drop to second in the table, while Milan move up to third, just a point behind their opponents.

Juventus were the better side in the first half and took the lead through Higuain in the 36th minute. The striker was left unmarked inside the area and headed home Douglas Costa’s cross.

The hosts continued to dominate after the break and doubled their lead in the 66th minute through Dybala. The Argentine international finished off a well-worked team move by curling a shot into the top corner from just outside the area.

Milan made a few changes in search of a way back into the game and it paid off in stoppage time when Calhanoglu fired home a free-kick from 25 yards out.

#  Roma held by Chievo while Lazio falls to Atalanta

Roma were held to a 0-0 draw by Chievo at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday, as they missed the chance to close in on second-placed Lazio.

Lazio were defeated 3-1 away at Atalanta, meaning that Roma are now just two points behind their city rivals with a game in hand.

Radja Nainggolan had the best chance of the first half for Roma, but his shot from the edge of the area was saved by Stefano Sorrentino.

Edin Dzeko also went close for Roma after the break, but his header was beaten away by Sorrentino.

Aleksandar Kolarov came closest to scoring for Roma late on, but his free-kick hit the wall and bounced wide.

Atalanta took the lead against Lazio through Andrea Masiello's header in the 36th minute, before captain Gianluigi Buffon produced a stunning save to deny Josip Ilicic minutes later.

Ilicic doubled Atalanta's lead in first-half stoppage time with a well-struck volley, and he added insult to injury for Lazio with his goal in the 63rd minute - which came moments after Berisha had denied Simone Inzaghi an equaliser.

#  Verona cause upset against Napoli

Verona produced one of the shocks of the season so far on Sunday by beating Serie A champions Napoli 2-1 at the San Siro.

Daniele Rugani and Federico Bernardeschi volleyed either side of halftime to give the visitors all three points, leaving Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri to lament his side's performance.

"We played very badly," he said. "Verona deserved to win."

It was only Verona's second win of the season and left them in 13th place, while Napoli slipped down to third behind Juventus and Inter Milan.

"In the first half we didn't play well but then we improved and deserved to get back in the game," said Verona midfielder Bruno Zuculini.

"We're happy with the victory but we have to continue like this."

#  Inter slump to another defeat, this time to Udinese

Inter Milan slumped to their fourth consecutive Serie A defeat on Sunday, going down 2-1 away to Udinese.

The result left the Nerazzurri in 16th place in the table, just two points above the relegation zone.

Ivan Perisic put Inter ahead early on but they were pegged back by Jakub Jankto’s equaliser and veteran striker Kevin Lasagna grabbed the winner for the hosts late on.

It was a disheartening result for Luciano Spalletti’s side, who had looked bright in the opening exchanges but failed to take their chances and were made to pay for it.

Inter now have a tough task on their hands if they are to rescue their season and get back into European contention.

They face a home game against Roma next weekend before travelling to Napoli and hosting Lazio, both of whom are in the top four.
