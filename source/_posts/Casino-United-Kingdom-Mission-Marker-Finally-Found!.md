#  Casino United Kingdom Mission Marker Finally Found!

In 2012, the University of Leicester announced that they had found the remains of King Richard III.

Just a few months ago, however, another discovery was made that may be even more significant than the finding of King Richard III’s remains.

A team from the University of Leicester has announced that they have found a mission marker from 1605 that proves that there was a casino in United Kingdom back in the early 17th century. This is an incredible find, as it is the first concrete evidence that casinos were present in Britain centuries ago.

The marker was found near Hinckley in Leicestershire, and it is thought to have been used to mark the spot where a group of Catholic missionaries were executed. The marker is inscribed with the words “Casino United Kingdom”, which confirms that there was indeed a casino in this part of Britain at the time.

Historians are still trying to figure out exactly what role casinos played in British society back in the early 17th century. It is possible that they were seen as shady establishments frequented by criminals and gamblers, or it is also possible that they were considered more respectable venues where people could enjoy a night out.

What is clear is that the discovery of this mission marker is a major breakthrough for historians and should help to shed light on some of the myths and misconceptions about casinos in Britain centuries ago.
