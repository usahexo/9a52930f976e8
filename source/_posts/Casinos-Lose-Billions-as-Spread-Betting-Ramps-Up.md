# Casinos Lose Billions as Spread Betting Ramps Up

The casino industry is on the decline as more people turn to spread betting as their preferred form of gambling. With taxes and other regulations making it increasingly difficult to make a profit, casino operators are looking for new ways to bring in gamblers.

Brexit has been a boon for spread betting companies, as many British citizens have turned to them in order to place bets on the outcome of the vote. This trend is likely to continue, as more people become aware of the benefits of spread betting.

Casinos have responded by offering their own versions of spread betting, but so far this has not been successful. The fact that casinos are not specialists in this area means that they are at a disadvantage when competing with the specialist companies.

In addition, the tighter restrictions on gambling mean that casinos are not able to offer the same range of bets as the specialist companies. This has resulted in a decline in revenue from gambling activities, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.

# Woman’s Insane Spread Bet Leads to Record Win

In one of the most impressive wins in gambling history, a woman walked away with more than ฿1.5 million after making a single spread bet on a soccer game.

The woman, who has not been identified, is reported to have made the bet by placing a 67-to-1 wager on Barcelona winning by at least five goals against Greek side Olympiacos.

With Barcelona cruising to a 5-0 victory, the woman’s winnings came in at over ฿1.5 million – a record for any spread bet ever made.

While the specifics of the woman’s bet are not known, it is thought that she may have used Ladbrokes’ ‘ ACCA Insurance ’ product to boost her chances of success.

This product allows customers to place bets on multiple outcomes of different events, with their stake being refunded if just one of their selections fails to win.

For this particular wager, the woman would have needed all five of her selections to win in order to make a profit.

This type of betting can be risky but it can also lead to some massive payouts if everything goes according to plan.

# Why I Love Spread Betting

I’ve been a spread bettor for years and there are many reasons why I love it. In this article, I will outline some of the main reasons why spread betting is my preferred way to trade the financial markets.

1. Ease of Use

One of the main benefits of spread betting is its ease of use. With a few clicks of the mouse, you can have a position open and be trading the markets. There is no need to download any software or to fill in complicated forms – everything can be done online in a matter of seconds.

2. No Commission Fees

Another benefit of spread betting is that there are no commission fees to pay. This means that you keep 100% of your profits, unlike with traditional stock trading where you typically have to pay commission fees each time you trade.

3. Tax-Free Profits

As with commission fees, all profits made through spread betting are tax-free. This is another major advantage over traditional stock trading, where profits are subject to capital gains tax. This makes spread betting a much more tax efficient way to trade the markets.

4. Wide Range of Markets Available

Another great thing about spread betting is that there is a wide range of markets available to trade. You can trade stocks, indices, commodities and Forex pairs, giving you plenty of options when it comes to finding profitable trades.

5. Leverage Options Available

Leverage allows you to trade with a much higher exposure than you would normally have available in your account balance. This means that you can make larger profits on small price movements (or losses if your prediction is wrong). Leverage also allows you to trade CFDs (contracts for difference) which give you even greater exposure to the markets than regular spread bets.

# How to Succeed at Spread Betting

Spread betting is a form of speculation that allows you to trade on the price differentials of securities and commodities. It is a very risky form of investment, but it can also be very lucrative if you know what you are doing. If you want to succeed at spread betting, here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Do your research

The first step to succeeding at spread betting is to do your research. This means learning as much as you can about the markets you are trading in, and understanding how they behave. It also means doing your own analysis, so that you can identify good trading opportunities.

2. Use stop losses

One of the biggest dangers of spread betting is that you can easily lose a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing. To protect yourself from losing too much money, use stop losses to limit your losses on bad trades.

3. Trade in size

Another mistake that new traders often make is trading too big. This can lead to big losses if things go wrong.Instead, start small and increase your position size as you become more comfortable with the markets and your trading strategy.

4. Stay disciplined

One of the keys to success in any form of trading is discipline. This means sticking to your Trading Plan, avoiding greed and fear, and taking profits when they are available.

# Is Spread Betting for You?

A spread bet is a type of betting where you stake money on whether a particular outcome will occur, but there’s a catch - the odds are not fixed and can change depending on how much money is staked on either side of the bet. Spread betting is done through bookmakers who lay out the odds for each possible outcome and then allow customers to back either side at different odds.

The beauty of spread betting is that your profits/losses are magnified in line with how much you stake, so it can be a particularly risky form of betting if you’re not careful. However, if used correctly it can also be a great way to make some high returns from relatively small stakes.

So, is spread betting for you? Here are a few things to consider:

1. Are you comfortable with taking risks?

As we said before, one of the key things to remember about spread betting is that your profits and losses are magnified in line with how much you stake. This means that even a small move in the markets can result in large profits or losses, so if you’re not comfortable with taking risks then this may not be the right form of betting for you.

2. Do you have a good understanding of the markets?

In order to make successful spread bets, it’s important to have a good understanding of the markets in which you’re trading. If you don’t know what you’re doing then it could be easy to make costly mistakes which could lead to big losses.

3. Can you afford to lose?

As we mentioned previously,spread betting can be very risky so it’s important that you can afford to lose any money that you put up as stakes. If you can’t afford to lose then this probably isn’t the right form of gambling for you.
