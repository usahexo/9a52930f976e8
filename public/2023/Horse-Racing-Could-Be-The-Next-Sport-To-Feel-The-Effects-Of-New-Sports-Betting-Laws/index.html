While professional and collegiate sports leagues have been preparing for this day for years, there is one sport that could be most affected by the change: horse racing.</p>
<p>For years, horse racing has been seen as a dying sport, with declining interest from fans and bettors alike. The legalization of sports betting could breathe new life into the industry, as fans and gamblers look to place their bets on races in addition to traditional sporting events. This could lead to an increase in revenue for horse racing tracks and breeders, as well as more exciting races with added excitement and money on the line.</p>
<p>However, there is also a risk that the legalization of sports betting could have a negative impact on horse racing. With more options available for placing bets, fans may be less likely to invest their money in a sport that they see as less lucrative than others. Additionally, increased competition from other forms of gambling (such as online casinos and poker) could siphon off some of the betting dollars that would traditionally go to horse racing.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the legal landscape around sports betting will shake out in the coming months and years. However, it is clear that horse racing stands to gain – or lose – a great deal from this major shift in U.S. gambling laws.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Sports-Betting-Hurt-Horse-Racing-Some-Say-Yes-Others-Disagree"><a href="#Will-Sports-Betting-Hurt-Horse-Racing-Some-Say-Yes-Others-Disagree" class="headerlink" title="Will Sports Betting Hurt Horse Racing? Some Say Yes, Others Disagree"></a>Will Sports Betting Hurt Horse Racing? Some Say Yes, Others Disagree</h1><p>There is a lot of money riding on horse racing. Literally. Billions of dollars are wagered on the sport each year, in part because it’s seen as a way to make some easy money. But some people are worried that the rise of sports betting might end up hurting the horse racing industry.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is a lot of money to be made in sports betting. In 2017, Americans bet over $149 billion on sporting events, with over $4 billion wagered on horse racing alone. And that number is only going to grow as more and more states legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>But there is also a lot of risk involved in sports betting. The average gambler loses around $500 a year, meaning that the vast majority of people who bet on sports lose money. That’s not good news for the horse racing industry, which is already struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>There are many who believe that the rise of sports betting will spell disaster for horse racing. Racing has always been thought of as a sport that can be won or lost in a single race, and as such it has always been popular with gamblers. But with sports betting becoming increasingly popular, gamblers are likely to shift their focus away from horse racing and towards other sports where they can get better odds.</p>
<p>That could be devastating for the horse racing industry, which is already struggling to attract new fans and investors. Racing faces competition from other forms of gambling, such as casinos and online poker, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to make a profit in the sport.</p>
<p>Sports betting may not be the death knell for horse racing that some people believe it to be, but it does present a serious threat to the sport’s future viability. If gambling shifts away from horse racing and towards other sports, then the industry could be in serious trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Horse-Racing-Officials-Prepare-For-Possible-Fallout-From-Sports-Betting-Ruling"><a href="#Horse-Racing-Officials-Prepare-For-Possible-Fallout-From-Sports-Betting-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="Horse Racing Officials Prepare For Possible Fallout From Sports Betting Ruling"></a>Horse Racing Officials Prepare For Possible Fallout From Sports Betting Ruling</h1><p>The Supreme Court’s decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to overturn the federal law prohibiting sports betting has left horse racing officials scrambling to prepare for what is expected to be a dramatic expansion of legal sports gambling.</p>
<p>“We’re still trying to understand all the implications of the ruling, but it’s clear that this is a major game changer,” said Alex Waldrop, president and CEO of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA). “We need to be proactive in formulating a strategy that will allow our industry to capitalize on this new opportunity while also protecting the interests of our fans, our stakeholders, and our horses.”</p>
<p>Waldrop said that one of the main priorities for the NTRA will be to ensure that there is a level playing field for all forms of legalized sports betting, including wagering on horse races. He also noted that the association will be meeting with state racing commissions and other industry representatives in the coming weeks to formulate a plan of action.</p>
<p>Marc Winter, executive director of The Jockey Club, said his organization is also preparing for a potential tidal wave of legal sports gambling.</p>
<p>“We are encouraged by today’s ruling and are committed to working with our partners at state racing commissions and other interested groups to ensure that horse racing maintains its important place in a well-regulated sports betting marketplace,” Winter said.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to know exactly how widespread legal sports gambling will become in light of the Supreme Court ruling, many observers believe that it could eventually become a multi-billion-dollar industry. That prospect has some people within the horse racing community concerned about potential negative impacts on their sport.</p>
<p>Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of rival racetrack operator Saratoga Harness, said he is worried about how much money bettors will end up diverting from horseracing to other forms of sports betting.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern is how this is going to affect handle [the amount wagered on horseracing], especially when you have football and basketball games being played every day during our season,” Ritvo told the Albany Times Union. “When people can bet legally on those games at any number of venues across the country as opposed to just betting on races, that could be trouble for us.”</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Decision-Leaves-Horse-Racing-In-Limbo"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Decision-Leaves-Horse-Racing-In-Limbo" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Decision Leaves Horse Racing In Limbo"></a>Sports Betting Decision Leaves Horse Racing In Limbo</h1><p>The sports betting industry is in a state of flux after the US Supreme Court overturned a law that effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide. The overturning of the law, which was known as PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>While a number of states have already taken steps to legalize sports betting, horse racing is in limbo. The sport is immensely popular in America, but it has largely been shut out of the legalized sports betting market. That could soon change, but there are still some questions about how horse racing will fit into the new landscape.</p>
<p>One big question is how horse racing will be impacted by the so-called “integrity fee” that many casinos are seeking to impose on sports bettors. The integrity fee would be a percentage of each bet that would go towards funding anti-corruption efforts in sports. Horse racing operators are concerned that they could be forced to pay such a fee, even though they don’t have any role in corrupting the sport.</p>
<p>There is also uncertainty about what kind of regulatory framework will be put in place for horse racing. Some states may choose to create separate regulations for horse racing, while others may simply fold it into their existing gambling laws. There is also concern about how online gambling will be regulated, as most horse races are now streamed online.</p>
<p>Overall, the overturning of PASPA has created an uncertain future for horse racing. But there is hope that the sport can find a place in the legalized sports betting market, albeit with some significant challenges ahead.</p>
<h1 id="horse-racing-industry-braces-for-impact-of-sports-betting-decision"><a href="#horse-racing-industry-braces-for-impact-of-sports-betting-decision" class="headerlink" title="horse racing industry braces for impact of sports betting decision"></a>horse racing industry braces for impact of sports betting decision</h1><p>The horse racing industry is bracing for the impact of a Supreme Court decision that could legalize sports betting across the United States.</p>
<p>The industry has been lobbying for years for Congress to pass a law legalizing sports betting, which it says would create jobs and boost tourism. But some lawmakers remain skeptical, warning of the potential for addiction and corruption.</p>
<p>Now that the Supreme Court is poised to hand down a decision in a case brought by New Jersey, the industry is preparing for the possibility that sports betting will be legalized nationwide.</p>
<p>“We’re cautiously optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the sport,” said Alex Waldrop, CEO of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. “But we also know there’s a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>Waldrop said his association has been meeting with casino operators and other stakeholders to come up with a plan for how to roll out legalized sports betting if the court rules in favor of New Jersey.</p>
<p>At issue is a federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, which prohibited states from authorizing sports betting. New Jersey challenged the law, arguing that it unfairly restricted states’ rights.</p>
<p>The court heard arguments in the case in December, and legal experts say it is likely to rule in favor of New Jersey. Such a ruling would overturn PASPA and open up the market for legalized sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally bet about $150 billion on sports each year. If sports betting were legalized, that number could jump to $338 billion by 2023, according to research by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming LLC.</p>
<p>That would be good news for casino operators and other stakeholders in the horse racing industry, which has seen its popularity decline in recent years. But it could also have negative consequences, including increased addiction and corruption.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have voiced concerns about those risks, and are urging caution as the Supreme Court prepares to rule.</p>
<p>“My worry is that you’ll have more people addicted; you’ll have more people whose families are ruined because they’ve got this horrific addiction,” said Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin). “You’ll have more organized crime; it just opens up Pandora’s box.”</p>
