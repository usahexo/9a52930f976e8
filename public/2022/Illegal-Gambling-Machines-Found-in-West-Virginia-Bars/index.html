<p>The raids were part of a statewide crackdown on establishments that operate the illegal machines.</p>
<p>According to police, the gambling machines are commonly used to illegally bet on sporting events or other games of chance.</p>
<p>In addition to the gambling machines, authorities also seized cash and other evidence linking the businesses to illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>So far, more than two dozen businesses have been raided as part of the crackdown.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a crime in West Virginia, and those caught operating or using the machines face significant fines and possible jail time.</p>
<h1 id="Eight-Video-Gambling-Machines-Found-in-High-Life-Lounges"><a href="#Eight-Video-Gambling-Machines-Found-in-High-Life-Lounges" class="headerlink" title="Eight Video Gambling Machines Found in High Life Lounges"></a>Eight Video Gambling Machines Found in High Life Lounges</h1><p>The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) announced today the seizure of eight video gambling machines from two High Life Lounges in Queens.</p>
<p>“These machines are illegal and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to shut them down,” said acting SLA Chairman Vincent Bradley.</p>
<p>The seized machines were found in Queens establishments at 108-19 Rockaway Boulevard and 108-04 Merrick Boulevard. The businesses were both licensed as restaurants but were using the machines for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>Under New York State law, video gambling machines are not permitted in any retail outlet where alcoholic beverages are sold or served.</p>
<p>Businesses caught with video gambling machines face significant penalties, including a potential license revocation and fines up to $10,000 per machine.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-Machines-Found-in-West-Virginia-Bars-Again"><a href="#Illegal-Machines-Found-in-West-Virginia-Bars-Again" class="headerlink" title="Illegal Machines Found in West Virginia Bars Again"></a>Illegal Machines Found in West Virginia Bars Again</h1><p>For the second time this year, illegal machines have been found in West Virginia bars.</p>
<p>The machines, which are similar to those found in casinos, offer players the chance to win money by playing games such as poker and blackjack.</p>
<p>While it is not illegal to own or operate the machines, it is illegal to do so in a public place.</p>
<p>This has not stopped some business owners from illegally installing the machines in their establishments.</p>
<p>Last month, agents with the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission raided two bars in Huntington and seized eight of the machines.</p>
<p>The owner of one of the bars was arrested and charged with violating state law.</p>
<p>“These illegal gambling devices are nothing more than a tool for criminal activity,” said ABC Commission Chair Charles Fitzsimmons. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and take action against those who attempt to use them for criminal gain.”</p>
<p>In January, agents seized 10 of the machines from three different bars in Wheeling.</p>
<h1 id="More-Illegal-Gambling-Machines-Discovered-in-West-Virginia"><a href="#More-Illegal-Gambling-Machines-Discovered-in-West-Virginia" class="headerlink" title="More Illegal Gambling Machines Discovered in West Virginia"></a>More Illegal Gambling Machines Discovered in West Virginia</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In yet another development in the ongoing saga of illegal gambling machines in West Virginia, law enforcement officials have discovered a new stash of the illicit devices. This brings the total number of known machines to well over one thousand.</p>
<p>The new discovery was made in Nicholas County, a rural area in the central part of the state. Authorities seized more than two hundred of the machines from a single business. This is just the latest in a spate of raids targeting illegal gambling operations throughout the state.</p>
<p>While officials have been tight-lipped about specific details, it is believed that this latest discovery is linked to a larger criminal organization. The seized machines are thought to be part of an elaborate scheme involving illegal lotteries and other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>This comes as authorities continue to crack down on illegal gambling in West Virginia. In August, law enforcement officials raided several businesses in Harrison County, seizing nearly four hundred machines. This was part of an effort to shut down what has been described as a ‘major’ illegal gambling operation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, officials also seized nearly two hundred machines from a business in Lincoln County. This followed raids on similar businesses in Upshur and Doddridge Counties. Overall, it is estimated that there are now over one thousand illegal gambling machines operating in West Virginia.</p>
<p>The proliferation of these machines has drawn criticism from lawmakers and others who argue that they can be used for nefarious purposes, such as money laundering and organized crime. Additionally, they say that the presence of these machines tends to prey on vulnerable populations, such as those with gambling addictions.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials insist that they are taking steps to address the issue, but critics contend that more needs to be done. They argue that the state needs to pass legislation specifically targeting illegal gambling operations and make it easier for authorities to prosecute those involved.</p>

<p>The West Virginia State Police teamed up with the Alcohol Beverage Control Administration (ABC) to conduct the raid at various businesses across the state.</p>
<p>The sweep came as a result of complaints from residents and business owners about the proliferation of illegal gambling machines.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is not only a crime, but it also hurts local businesses that are trying to operate legitimately,” said ABC Administrator Shawn Bayly.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a misdemeanor in West Virginia, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Businesses that are caught operating video gambling machines face civil penalties of up to $5,000 per machine.</p>
