This game has players scratching off tiles to reveal symbols in order to win prizes. So how much do dealers at Rivers Casino make from this game?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we first need to take a look at the payouts for the Tiger scratch game. The following table shows the prize amounts for various combinations of symbols revealed:</p>
<p>As you can see, the prizes for this game range from $2 to $1,000. Now let’s take a look at how much a dealer at Rivers Casino would make from a typical winning ticket.</p>
<p>If we assume that a player wins the $1,000 prize, then the dealer would earn a commission of $100 on that ticket. In other words, the dealer would earn 10% of the prize amount for that ticket. So if a dealer sells 100 tickets per shift, then they would earn an average of $1,000 per shift in commissions. This would be equivalent to earning around $20 per hour in commissions.</p>
<p>While this may not be glamorous work, it is a steady income and it can be exciting when someone wins a big prize. If you are interested in becoming a casino dealer, then Rivers Casino may be a good place to start. They offer training and certification courses to help you get started in this exciting field.</p>
