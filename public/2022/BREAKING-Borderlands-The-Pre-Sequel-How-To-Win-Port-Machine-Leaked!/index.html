<p>Dubbed “The Holy Grail of Loot,” the port machine is a central gameplay element in Borderlands The Pre-Sequel. It allows players to trade their hard-won loot for better gear, with the possibility of scoring some of the game’s most coveted items.</p>
<p>So how do you win at the port machine? According to gamer and YouTuber LIRIK, it all comes down to patience and persistence. In his video guide on obtaining the ultimate gear from the port machine, LIRIK lays out a step-by-step process for maximizing your chances of success. Here are his top tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start with low-level gear. When first using the port machine, it’s best to start with low-level gear and work your way up. This will give you a higher chance of getting better loot from the port machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use high level weapons. Once you’ve reached a high enough level, start using powerful weapons to increase your chances of getting good loot from the port machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play co-op mode. Playing co-op mode with friends will give you a better chance of getting good loot from the port machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use rare guns&#x2F;items. The rarer an item is, the better its chances of being obtained from the port machine. So if you want to win big, try using rare guns and items in your runs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Borderland-The-Pre-Sequel-How-To-Win-At-The-Port-Machine"><a href="#Borderland-The-Pre-Sequel-How-To-Win-At-The-Port-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Borderland The Pre Sequel: How To Win At The Port Machine!"></a>Borderland The Pre Sequel: How To Win At The Port Machine!</h1><p>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a great game that offers tons of hours of enjoyment. One of the many things that makes this game great is the Port Machine, which allows players to trade in their loot for new weapons and other goodies. However, many players struggle with this mini-game and end up losing a lot of money. In this article, we will go over some tips on how to win at the Port Machine!</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is understand how the mini-game works. The Port Machine has four different slots, each one corresponding to a different rarity tier: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Ultra-Rare. In order to get the best rewards from the machine, you need to put in items that correspond to the slot’s rarity tier. For example, if you want to get an Ultra-Rare weapon from the machine, you need to put in an Ultra-Rare item. </p>
<p>You also need to make sure that you are putting in the correct type of item. Weapons go into the Weapon slot, shields go into the Shield slot, grenade mods go into the Grenade Mod slot, etc. If you put in something that doesn’t belong in a particular slot, it will be worth nothing when you pull out your new weapon or shield. </p>
<p>Another thing you need to keep in mind is that modded weapons are not worth as much as their unmodded counterparts. For example, a Level 5 Unmodded Maliwan SMG might be worth 500 currency points at the machine, while a Level 5 modded Maliwan SMG might only be worth 350 currency points. Always be sure to unequip any mods before trading them in at the Port Machine! </p>
<p>Now that we have gone over some of the basics, let’s move on to some tips on how to win at this mini-game! </p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is start with high quality items. This means putting in items that have a high rarity tier and are also unmodified (or only lightly modified). This will give you a good chance of getting a good weapon or shield from the machine. </p>
<p>Another thing you can do is try and predict what type of item you will get from the machine. If you are trying to get an assault rifle for example, try putting in uncommon or rare assault rifles instead of shields or pistols. This way, you have a better chance of getting an assault rifle rather than something else entirely. </p>
<p>Lastly, always remember that patience is key! Sometimes it takes several tries before getting an item that you actually want from the machine. Be patient and keep trying until you get something that works for you!</p>

Recently, hackers have revealed how to hack the port machine in order to get the best loot every time.</p>
<p>The way the port machine works is that it gives different rewards depending on what type of ship you select. There are three types of ships: green, blue, and purple. The green ship gives you common rewards, the blue ship gives you uncommon rewards, and the purple ship gives you rare rewards.</p>
<p>The hackers discovered that you can change which type of ship you get by editing a file on your computer. By editing this file, you can make it so that the port machine always gives you a blue or purple ship, which will give you better loot every time.</p>
<p>This hack has been confirmed to work on all platforms (PC, Xbox One, and PS4). So far there have been no reports of anyone getting banned for using this hack, but use it at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you want to try out this hack for yourself, here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you have an unmodified copy of Borderlands Pre sequel installed on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to your computer’s file system and find the “borderlandspresequel” folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the “borderlandspresequel” folder and find the “gameconfig” file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit the “gameconfig” file with a text editor (such as Notepad) and change line 9 from “ShipChoice&#x3D;0” to “ShipChoice&#x3D;1”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Save the changes to the “gameconfig” file and close it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch Borderlands Pre sequel and go to the port machine room.</p>
</li>

But then came the waiting game as we all patiently waited for the release date.</p>
<p>And once it finally arrived, many of us dove right in… only to find ourselves struggling with the port machine at one of the key points in the game.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck on what to do next, don’t worry – I’m here to help!</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll reveal some tips that will help you win at Borderlands The Pre-Sequel’s port machine. With these tips, you’ll be on your way to completing the game and unlocking its many secrets!</p>
<ol>
<li>Use weapons with high fire rates</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important aspects of winning at the port machine is using a weapon with a high fire rate. This will help ensure that you hit your targets more accurately and make it easier to chain together combos.</p>
<p>Some good weapons to use include SMGs and assault rifles – both of which have high fire rates and are available early on in the game.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stay mobile</li>
</ol>
<p>Another key component of winning at the port machine is staying mobile. This means avoiding enemy fire by constantly moving around and taking cover behind objects.</p>
<p>This tactic will also help you stay alive longer and make it harder for enemies to hit you. As an added bonus, it will also help build your combo meter faster!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use grenades wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Grenades can be a powerful tool when used correctly in battle. However, they can also be a hindrance if used incorrectly. Here are a few tips for using grenades to your advantage:</p>
<p>• Try not to throw them indiscriminately – this will only give your enemies more opportunities to hit you. Instead, try targeting specific enemies or groups of enemies with your grenades. This will make them much more effective!</p>
<p>• Don’t waste valuable grenades on small clusters of enemies – they won’t provide enough damage to be worth it. Save them for tougher encounters where they can really make a difference!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use powerups wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Powerups can be extremely helpful when fighting enemies at the port machine. Here are a few tips for using them effectively:</p>
<p>• Übercharge is extremely useful for boosting your firepower and helping you take down tougher enemies quickly. Make sure to use it when needed!</p>
<p>• The shield powerup is also very helpful, especially if you’re fighting against tough bosses or large groups of enemies. Make sure to use it whenever its available!</p>

Each one has a slightly different way of being beaten, but all of them can be won with a bit of perseverance.</p>
<p>The reward wheel is the simplest to beat - just spin it until you get the item you want. The vending machine is a little harder, as you need to find the right combination of items to get the reward you want, but it’s still relatively easy to do. The slot machine is by far the hardest, as it takes skill and luck to get the right combination of symbols. However, with a bit of practice, it’s possible to win every time.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-win-at-the-reward-wheel"><a href="#How-to-win-at-the-reward-wheel" class="headerlink" title="How to win at the reward wheel"></a>How to win at the reward wheel</h1><p>The reward wheel is by far the easiest machine to beat in Borderlands The Pre-Sequel. Just spin it until you get the item you want - there’s no real strategy involved. However, there are a few tips that can make things a little easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use your character’s ability to increase your chances of getting better rewards. For example, Wilhelm’s ability increases the number of legendary items that can drop from the wheel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you’re using an appropriate character for the type of item you’re trying to get. For example, if you’re trying to get a weapon, use a character like Axton who has good fire rate and weapon damage bonuses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep an eye on what other players are getting from the wheel and try to copy their strategy. If they’re getting good rewards, there’s a good chance that their strategy will work for you too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-win-at-the-vending-machine"><a href="#How-to-win-at-the-vending-machine" class="headerlink" title="How to win at the vending machine"></a>How to win at the vending machine</h1><p>The vending machine can be beaten more easily than the reward wheel, but it still requires some skill and knowledge about what combinations of items will give you the rewards you want. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use your character’s ability to increase your chances of getting better rewards. For example, Nisha’s ability increases her chance of getting rare items from vending machines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you’re using an appropriate character for the type of item you’re trying to get. For example, if you’re trying to get a weapon, use Maya who has good fire rate and weapon damage bonuses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
